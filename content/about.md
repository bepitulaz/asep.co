My name is Asep Bagja Priandana from Indonesia. You can call me Asep. I grew up in several cities in Indonesia. My family was a nomadic because my father worked as a government auditor. I studied accounting in Universitas Islam Indonesia. Despite of my formal education background, I started my professional career as a web developer in 2009 because technology is my passion.

Today, I'm a paralel entrepreneur. I manage and co-found my companies: [Tanibox](https://tanibox.com) and [Chlo√® & Matt](https://chloematt.com), together with my wife, Retno Ika Safitri.
