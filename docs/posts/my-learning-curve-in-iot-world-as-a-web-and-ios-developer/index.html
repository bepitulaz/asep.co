    </header>

    <p>As a web developer and iOS developer, I didn&rsquo;t know much about hardware or bare metal programming. I only learned about resistor, capasitor, transistor, etc when I was still in junior high school, thus my electronic knowledge is very limited.</p>

<p><strong>Arduino Uno R3. My First Board.</strong></p>

<p>I was interested for learning electronic again as a hobby around 2-3 years ago, when I read that Arduino is easy for learning micro controller programming. I bought it for IDR190.000 (around USD15). I also ordered a bread board for prototyping, some jumper cables, and a pair of LEDs.</p>

<p>I must admit that it was not easy enough for the first time. I had to learn Arduino IDE with Processing language, and learned some jargons that I never knew before in web programming e.g., baud rate, digital pin, analog pin, Tx/Rx, serial port, etc. Finally, I can made my first project run. It was blinking the LED project. Arduino IDE makes everything simple, from writing the code (sketch) until uploading it to the board.</p>

<p>Today, learning Arduino programming from web development background is getting easier. We can do it by using JavaScript with NodeJS and Johnny-Five package.</p>

<p><strong>Raspberry Pi. Small Linux Board with ARM Processor.</strong></p>

<p>After doing some small toy projects in Arduino platform, I read about Raspberry Pi the $35 credit card size computer. The first time I knew about GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output) was from this board, and with this board also I learned how to build a cross compiler toolchain for compiling C program from OSX to RPi. I was using this board for various purposes, mostly for home entertainment.</p>

<p>My latest hobby project was building the automation system for my aquarium. It utilized RPi to control servo motor for rotating the fish food dispenser over the internet. I built it by using NodeJS, SocketIO, and <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/johnny-five">Johnny-Five</a> package.</p>

<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oNoDhwC3RDk" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>

<p>The problem came when I want to deploy it on my aquarium. I felt $35 was not worth to be placed as a permanent installation, because I still need the RPi for my home entertainment. So, I should find the cheap way. Arduino obviously not the cheap way. It is $15, but if I want to connect it to the internet I should buy either ethernet shield or the expensive wifi shield.</p>

<p>My friend gave me a solution via Twitter. He mentioned about&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>ESP8266. The $5 Wifi Module.</strong></p>

<p>I google-ed it. It is a new wifi module that people usually use it as a module for Arduino, but actually it can be used as a stand alone micro controller. So, I ordered it for IDR70.000, also with USB TTY programmer for IDR22000. The total shopping was just IDR99.000 (around $7). It is worth to solder permanently.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/asepco/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/25200525/esp-8266.jpg" alt="esp-8266" /></p>

<p>The USB TTY is used to program the micro controller. ESP8266 has 2 GPIO pins and working with 3.3 volt power. I can&rsquo;t use JavaScript for this hardware, thus it becomes my first time for writing my own firmware in C and deploy (flash) it to a hardware that don&rsquo;t have operating system. Now, I&rsquo;m in progress for porting my aquarium system to use this coin size and cheap module.</p>

<p>I will write the tutorial about how to use it in the next post.</p>
