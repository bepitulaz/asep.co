      <description>Today, September 21, 2015, I&amp;rsquo;m officially 28 years old.
Many people say 28 is the starting age to enter adulthood. In astrology, they call it Saturn Return. It is a period for Saturn completing its full orbit around the Sun, and Saturn is returning to the position when the people were born.
Whatever people talk about the age of 28, I believe it is the age for starting something matters and meaningful in my life and my career.</description>
