        <p><em>One of the biggest problem of having pet is filling its needs while the owner leaving the home.</em></p>

<p>I had an aquarium which was filled with 7 fish, and the fish should be fed at least once a day or better twice a day in small portion. A week ago, I and my wife must left our home for celebrating Eid together at my parent&rsquo;s home in another town, thus it led me for creating an automation system to feed my fish.</p>

<p>Three days before the departure, I started to create it. I have an Arduino Uno R3, an ESP8266 wifi module, a Tower Pro SG90 micro servo, and a Starbucks&rsquo; juice bottle as a fish food container. My first design was making a system that can tell me via email if it successfully feeds the fish twice a day, but then I remembered that my current home doesn&rsquo;t has always-on-internet. So, I ditched the email feature and surely I didn&rsquo;t need to use ESP8266.</p>

<p>Then I moved with second design. The Arduino would be rotating the servo twice a day without notified me whether it fed the fish successfully or not. I tested it several times, and 150% sure that this device worked with zero bug in code.</p>

<p>I left my home confidently.</p>

<p>Yesterday, I arrived to my home. Open the door. Stank very bad smell. What the hell was going here? Oh my God! All the fish was floated up on the thicken water. I assessed they had died for 3 days because of ammonia and not by automation system failure.</p>

<p>The catastrophic came from my prepaid home electricity. It showed 000 kwh (kilo watt hour), hence my aquarium pump and filter was turning off and couldn&rsquo;t cleaning up the food leftover. I miscalculated the power usage of all electricities in my home. I should bought more KWh before I left, but I didn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>The lessons that I learned here are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Prepare the automation system with backup battery. I have a plan to create mini solar powered battery system as a backup from the main electricity.</li>
<li>Making a simple app that can calculate the amount of needed kwh for all home appliances.
