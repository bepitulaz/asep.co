      <description>One of the biggest problem of having pet is filling its needs while the owner leaving the home.
I had an aquarium which was filled with 7 fish, and the fish should be fed at least once a day or better twice a day in small portion. A week ago, I and my wife must left our home for celebrating Eid together at my parent&amp;rsquo;s home in another town, thus it led me for creating an automation system to feed my fish.</description>

      <description>As a web developer and iOS developer, I didn&amp;rsquo;t know much about hardware or bare metal programming. I only learned about resistor, capasitor, transistor, etc when I was still in junior high school, thus my electronic knowledge is very limited.
Arduino Uno R3. My First Board.
I was interested for learning electronic again as a hobby around 2-3 years ago, when I read that Arduino is easy for learning micro controller programming.</description>
