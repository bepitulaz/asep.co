      <description>Why I&amp;rsquo;m deeply in love with Clojure? That&amp;rsquo;s because I can do full stack development only in one language. I can write HTML with the same Clojure data structure, then styling it by writing CSS in exactly the same data structure. When I need to do user interface development, I can use ClojureScript then compile it into JavaScript. Actually writing ClojureScript is more pleasant than writing vanilla JavaScript. How about the backend development?</description>

      <title>Integrating React Bootstrap and Reagent</title>

      <description>This weekend, I am experimenting to use React Bootstrap with ClojureScript. For whom that doesn&amp;rsquo;t know it yet, React Bootstrap is a Bootstrap 3 component built with ReactJS. I&amp;rsquo;m using Reagent library for interacting with React from ClojureScript, instead of Om.
Integrating React Bootstrap and Reagent was confusing me at the first. It was non-trivial effort. I searched Google and got no relevant solutions for hours. So, this working solution is based on my trial and error experimentation.</description>
