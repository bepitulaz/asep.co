      <description>As a web developer and iOS developer, I didn&amp;rsquo;t know much about hardware or bare metal programming. I only learned about resistor, capasitor, transistor, etc when I was still in junior high school, thus my electronic knowledge is very limited.
Arduino Uno R3. My First Board.
I was interested for learning electronic again as a hobby around 2-3 years ago, when I read that Arduino is easy for learning micro controller programming.</description>
