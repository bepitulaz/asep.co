      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since my last post on this website. Three years ago. It&amp;rsquo;s time to dust off and start writing again. I want to challenge my self, &amp;ldquo;how if I make this blog like a social media?&amp;rdquo; I will prioritise to post anything here instead of posting in social media whether it&amp;rsquo;s a short or long content.
This blog post is the first attempt. Wish me luck with the idea!</description>

      <description>My name is Asep Bagja Priandana from Indonesia. You can call me Asep. I grew up in several cities in Indonesia. My family was a nomadic because my father worked as a government auditor. I studied accounting in Universitas Islam Indonesia. Despite of my formal education background, I started my professional career as a web developer in 2009 because technology is my passion.
Today, I&amp;rsquo;m a paralel entrepreneur. I manage and co-found my companies: Tanibox and Chloè &amp;amp; Matt, together with my wife, Retno Ika Safitri.</description>

      <title>28 Years Old. Do Something Matters Now.</title>

      <description>Today, September 21, 2015, I&amp;rsquo;m officially 28 years old.
Many people say 28 is the starting age to enter adulthood. In astrology, they call it Saturn Return. It is a period for Saturn completing its full orbit around the Sun, and Saturn is returning to the position when the people were born.
Whatever people talk about the age of 28, I believe it is the age for starting something matters and meaningful in my life and my career.</description>
