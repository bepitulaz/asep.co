      <title>Introduction to Functional Programming in JavaScript (Part 2)</title>

      <description>In part 1, we had learned about two important concepts in functional programming paradigm: immutable data and pure function. Now, we will learn another important concept in functional programming, that is higher order function.
According to Wikipedia, higher-order function is a function that does at least one of the following:
 takes one or more functions as arguments returns a function as its results.  JavaScript has the first-class function. It means the functions in JavaScript treats as a value, that we can assign it to the variable, pass it around, and return from another function.</description>

      <description>Imperative programming is a programming paradigm that uses a sequence of statements to reach a certain goal. It focuses on how to perform actions to achieve the expected result. Otherwise, functional programming paradigm concentrates on computing results rather than performing actions. In another word, the imperative one is an annoying micromanager in your office, and the functional one is a macromanager who just describe what&amp;rsquo;s the job to be done.</description>

      <description>Google announced that they use HTTPS as a ranking signal on 2014, and it becomes more standard in their search result. Therefore, I decide to use HTTPS also for this blog; and it looks pretty too for having a green lock icon on the browser. I&amp;rsquo;m a Docker devotee, so I&amp;rsquo;ll show you how to do it by using Docker.
1. Install Docker on the server
I&amp;rsquo;m using Ubuntu 16.04 on my Digital Ocean droplet.</description>

      <title>Simple, Cheap, and Scalable IoT Data Logging With Clojure</title>

      <description>I have a small green house in my home front yard, and I deployed some sensors like temperature, humidity, electrical conductivity (EC), and pH sensor there.
After the development of the sensors completed, it was the time for me to develop the web service for logging the data. I considered to use NoSQL database for persistent data storage. Otherwise I dismissed that idea for the sake of cost efficiency.
To use NoSQL database, I should open one or two servers in cloud provider for running it.</description>

      <description>Geekcamp Jakarta 2015 is a technology and business conference organized by KMKLabs. This is my presentation about computer generated music using Clojure and Overtone. The talk is using Bahasa Indonesia, but here I try to give the English transcript.
 Transcript
[00:20] I want to talk about music. Who loves music here? I&amp;rsquo;m sure many of you loves music.
[00:27] Are there many programmers here? Because it will relates with code also.</description>

      <title>Full Stack Clojure Project</title>

      <description>Why I&amp;rsquo;m deeply in love with Clojure? That&amp;rsquo;s because I can do full stack development only in one language. I can write HTML with the same Clojure data structure, then styling it by writing CSS in exactly the same data structure. When I need to do user interface development, I can use ClojureScript then compile it into JavaScript. Actually writing ClojureScript is more pleasant than writing vanilla JavaScript. How about the backend development?</description>

      <title>Integrating React Bootstrap and Reagent</title>

      <description>This weekend, I am experimenting to use React Bootstrap with ClojureScript. For whom that doesn&amp;rsquo;t know it yet, React Bootstrap is a Bootstrap 3 component built with ReactJS. I&amp;rsquo;m using Reagent library for interacting with React from ClojureScript, instead of Om.
Integrating React Bootstrap and Reagent was confusing me at the first. It was non-trivial effort. I searched Google and got no relevant solutions for hours. So, this working solution is based on my trial and error experimentation.</description>

      <title>My Learning Curve In IoT World As A Web and iOS Developer</title>

      <description>As a web developer and iOS developer, I didn&amp;rsquo;t know much about hardware or bare metal programming. I only learned about resistor, capasitor, transistor, etc when I was still in junior high school, thus my electronic knowledge is very limited.
Arduino Uno R3. My First Board.
I was interested for learning electronic again as a hobby around 2-3 years ago, when I read that Arduino is easy for learning micro controller programming.</description>

      <description>This is the story of my life about my relationship with some programming languages from the first time I learnt computer programming until now. It was like finding a life partner.
Pascal
I met her around 2003 from my high school accounting teacher. She was my very first date in programming world. I tried to digest how to do programming and what I can do with programming. My relationship with Pascal was very short.</description>
