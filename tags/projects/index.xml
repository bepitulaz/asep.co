      <description>Currently, I&amp;rsquo;m developing an indoor farming system to grow vegetables (at the moment is Lettuce) and herbs in my house. You can check the project&amp;rsquo;s progress on my Hackaday&amp;rsquo;s page. The system should controls the lighting on and off at the correct time, logs the temperature and humidity and triggers the fan based on it, and sends the farm log to the server, so, I can predict the harvest time and the farm optimal condition in the future.</description>

      <description>One of the biggest problem of having pet is filling its needs while the owner leaving the home.
I had an aquarium which was filled with 7 fish, and the fish should be fed at least once a day or better twice a day in small portion. A week ago, I and my wife must left our home for celebrating Eid together at my parent&amp;rsquo;s home in another town, thus it led me for creating an automation system to feed my fish.</description>
